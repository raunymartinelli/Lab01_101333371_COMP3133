# Lab01_101333371_COMP3133

This Node.js project is part of COMP3133 (Full Stack Development course). It demonstrates reading a CSV file, filtering data based on specific criteria, and writing the output to separate text files.

## Description

The script in this project processes an `input_countries.csv` file. It filters the data for two specific countries - Canada and the United States - and writes this filtered data to two separate files, `canada.txt` and `usa.txt`. The project utilizes Node.js core modules like `fs` for file system operations and `csv-parser` for parsing CSV files.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- csv-parser (Node.js library)

### Installing

- Clone the repository or download the source code.
- Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies (`csv-parser`).

### Executing Program

- Place the `input_countries.csv` file in the root directory of the project.
- Run the script with the command `node index.js`.
- Check the output in `canada.txt` and `usa.txt` files generated in the root directory.

## Help

If you encounter any issues, verify the following:
- The `input_countries.csv` file is correctly placed in the project directory.
- Node.js is properly installed and up-to-date.
